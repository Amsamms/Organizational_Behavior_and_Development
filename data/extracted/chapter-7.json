  "title": "Evaluation, Feedback, and Rewards",
  "overview": "This chapter examines how organizations evaluate employee performance, provide feedback, and administer rewards to influence behavior, motivation, and organizational outcomes. The chapter emphasizes the critical link between performance evaluation systems and reward systems for maximum effectiveness.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Performance evaluation systems must be linked with reward systems to achieve maximum effectiveness",
    "Performance evaluation serves both judgmental purposes (reward allocation, identifying high-potential employees) and developmental purposes (performance improvement, training identification)",
    "360-degree feedback provides more comprehensive evaluation by gathering input from multiple sources including peers, supervisors, subordinates, and self-assessment",
    "Reinforcement theory explains how consequences shape behavior through positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction",
    "Different reinforcement schedules (continuous, fixed interval, variable interval, fixed ratio, variable ratio) produce different behavioral patterns",
    "Not all rewards are reinforcers - reinforcers specifically increase the rate of behavior",
    "Intrinsic rewards are self-administered (achievement, autonomy, personal growth) while extrinsic rewards come from outside sources (salary, benefits, promotions)",
    "Satisfaction with rewards depends on both the amount received and comparisons with others",
    "Effective reward packages must be sufficient to satisfy basic needs, equitable, and individually oriented",
    "Motivation alone cannot ensure good performance - ability, skill, and experience are also required",
    "Innovative reward systems include skill-based pay, broadbanding, team-based rewards, gain-sharing, and employee stock ownership plans",
    "Line of sight - the clear linkage between performance and rewards - is critical for reward effectiveness",
    "Rewards significantly impact turnover, absenteeism, job performance, and organizational commitment",
    "Feedback serves both instructional and motivational purposes in performance management",
    "No research substantiates that extrinsic rewards have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation"
